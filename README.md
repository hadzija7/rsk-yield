# 🛡️ RSK Attestor

**A decentralized credit scoring and identity attestation infrastructure for DeFi and beyond.**

## 🚀 Overview

RSK Attestor introduces a new financial primitive: decentralized credit scores linked to verifiable identities. By integrating this infrastructure with DeFi protocols, users can unlock personalized financial services—such as improved Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios—based on their creditworthiness.

Whether you're building in Web3 or bridging to TradFi, RSK Attestor enables you to bring trust and context to permissionless finance.

## 🧠 Problem

DeFi currently suffers from:

- **Lack of Identity:** No persistent or trustworthy financial identity for users.
- **Flat Risk Models:** Uniform LTV ratios regardless of user behavior.
- **Poor TradFi Compatibility:** DeFi user data is siloed and not useful off-chain.

## 🎯 Target Market

- **DeFi Protocols:** Lending, identity, and reputation protocols needing risk differentiation.
- **TradFi & Fintechs:** Platforms seeking DeFi-native credit insights for crypto-savvy borrowers.
- **Emerging Markets:** Cross-border lending apps targeting underbanked populations.
